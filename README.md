DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1 
Design a Basic ALU Supporting Operations like Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT
The first task in this VLSI internship required designing a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that can perform essential operations such as Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. An ALU is one of the most critical components of any digital system or microprocessor, as it carries out all arithmetic and logic operations. The goal was to implement this functionality using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), and simulate it using tools like ModelSim or Xilinx Vivado.

For this task, I used the Verilog HDL language to write the ALU logic. I chose VS Code (Visual Studio Code) as my text editor because of its clean interface and excellent support for Verilog extensions. I simulated the ALU design using ModelSim, a widely-used simulation tool that is capable of visualizing signal waveforms and debugging hardware behavior.

The ALU design includes multiple input lines to accept operands (say A and B), a select line to choose the operation (like a 3-bit control signal), and an output line to display the result. The operations implemented were:

Addition (A + B)

Subtraction (A - B)

AND (A & B)

OR (A | B)

NOT (~A)

To make the design scalable and testable, I also wrote a testbench. A testbench is a simulation file used to apply different inputs to the ALU and observe whether the expected outputs are being generated. I tested all possible combinations of inputs and operation select lines to validate the design.

This kind of task is extremely applicable in the real-world semiconductor industry. ALUs form the core of all CPUs, microcontrollers, and DSPs (Digital Signal Processors). Understanding how to design a functional ALU gives a strong foundation in digital logic and VLSI design. This task mimics the first steps taken by actual chip design engineers in processor development.

Moreover, this task helped me learn modular coding in Verilog, how to simulate digital circuits, and how to debug timing or logic errors. I also learned how to use waveform viewers in ModelSim to understand the behavior of the system over time.

In summary, Task 1 was a fundamental but powerful entry point into digital design using Verilog. It demonstrated how simple Boolean logic and arithmetic can be composed into a unit that serves as the "brain" of any processor. Such an exercise is not only academically useful but forms the foundation for careers in processor architecture, embedded systems, and digital logic design.
